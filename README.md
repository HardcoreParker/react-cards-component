# Material Design Cards with React

## Purpose

This is a small component I wrote with React as a part of a larger project that I didn't finish and sits happily retired in my private Git Graveyard. I've recently found some good reasons to expose a few of my completed works, and this is my favorite React sub-project.

## Pardon the mess

I not only wrote this when I was initially learning React (and had yet to see the light of staying away from dependencies you don't know how you're leveraging), but also when [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and Webpack combined for like... 40 dependencies and hundreds of lines of config code in the boilerplate setup. Since I've frantically pulled this from its grave over the course of the last hour, I haven't gotten a chance to clean up a lot of that junk left behind. Which brings me to...

## The meat and potatoes

To run

`npm install`

`npm start`

To read, you'll want to direct your attention to the [Cards directory](https://github.com/HardcoreParker/react-cards-component/tree/master/src/components/Cards). I put this together with `React`, `Stylus`. and `ES5` with some `ES6` sprinked in.
